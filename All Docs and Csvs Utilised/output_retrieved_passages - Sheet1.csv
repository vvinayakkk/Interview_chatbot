In Java, multithreading is achieved by extending the Thread class or implementing the Runnable interface. Threads can be created, started, paused, resumed, and terminated, providing a high level of control over the execution flow. However, multithreading also introduces challenges such as thread synchronization, resource sharing, and deadlock prevention, which need to be carefully addressed to ensure the correctness and reliability of the application.","['Explain the concept of thread synchronization in multithreading', 'How can deadlock be prevented in a multithreaded Java program?', 'Why is it important to carefully address challenges like thread synchronization and resource sharing in multithreading?']"
Java Multithreading,Thread Creation and Execution:,Easy,"Creating and executing threads in Java involves two main steps: thread creation and thread execution. Thread creation can be done by either extending the Thread class or implementing the Runnable interface. Extending the Thread class requires overriding the run() method, which contains the code that will be executed when the thread starts. Implementing the Runnable interface requires implementing the run() method as well. Once the thread is created, it can be started by calling the start() method, which internally calls the run() method. The start() method ensures that the thread is executed in a separate thread of control, allowing it to run concurrently with other threads.

The get() method will return the value associated with the specified key, or null if the key is not found in the LinkedHashMap. To remove a key-value pair from a LinkedHashMap, you can use the remove() method and specify the key you want to remove. The remove() method will remove the key-value pair if the key is found in the LinkedHashMap. LinkedHashMap also provides methods to perform operations such as checking if a key or value exists in the map, getting the size of the map, and iterating over the key-value pairs. You can use the containsKey() method to check if a specific key exists, the containsValue() method to check if a specific value exists, the size() method to get the number of key-value pairs in the map, and the entrySet() method to get a set of all key-value pairs. In addition to the basic operations, LinkedHashMap also provides methods to convert the map to an array or a list. You can use the keySet() method to get a set of all keys, the values() method to get a collection of all values, and the ArrayList constructor to convert the map to a list. Overall, LinkedHashMap is a versatile data structure in Java for storing key-value pairs while maintaining the order of the elements. It provides efficient performance, allows null values, and supports various operations. Whether you need to put, get, or remove key-value pairs, LinkedHashMap can handle it all.","['What method can you use to create a synchronized version of a LinkedHashMap?', 'How can you remove a key-value pair from a LinkedHashMap?', 'What methods does a LinkedHashMap provide to perform operations such as checking if a key or value exists, getting the size of the map, and iterating over the key-value pairs?']"
Java Variables,Stack,Easy,"A PriorityQueue is an implementation of the Queue interface in Java Collections. It is used to store a collection of elements in a priority order. The elements in a PriorityQueue are ordered based on their natural ordering or a custom comparator. To create a PriorityQueue, you need to import the java.util package and declare a variable of type PriorityQueue. You can then add elements to the PriorityQueue using the add() method. The elements are stored in the priority order and can be accessed using the poll() method. PriorityQueue has several advantages over other collection types. Firstly, it maintains the elements in a priority order, which makes it useful for scenarios where you need to process the elements in a specific order. Secondly, PriorityQueue allows duplicate elements, so you can have multiple elements with the same priority. Additionally, PriorityQueue provides methods to perform operations such as checking if an element exists in the queue and getting the size of the queue. To remove an element from a PriorityQueue, you can use the poll() method. The poll() method will remove and return the element with the highest priority. To check if a PriorityQueue contains a specific element, you can use the contains() method. This method returns true if the element is found in the PriorityQueue and false otherwise. PriorityQueue also provides methods to retrieve the first element in the queue and to iterate over the elements in priority order. You can use the peek() method to get the first element without removing it, and the iterator() method to get an iterator over the elements. In addition to the basic operations, PriorityQueue also provides methods to convert the queue to an array or a list.

Java Variables,The try-catch-finally Block,Easy,"In Java, exceptions are categorized into two types: checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions. Checked exceptions are exceptions that the compiler requires the programmer to handle explicitly.

By using the throw statement effectively, developers can create more robust and error-resistant code that handles exceptional situations gracefully.","['What happens when a throw statement is encountered in Java?', 'What happens if no catch block is found to handle a thrown exception?', 'How can the throw statement be useful in Java programming?']"
Java Variables,Custom Exception Classes,Hard,"In Java, the throw statement is used to explicitly throw an exception. It allows developers to create and throw custom exceptions or rethrow exceptions that were caught earlier. The throw statement is typically used when a specific error condition is encountered and the program cannot proceed further. throw exception; Here, ""exception"" can be an object of any class that extends the Throwable class. It can be a built-in exception class or a custom exception class created by the developer. When a throw statement is encountered, the program flow is immediately transferred to the nearest catch block that can handle the thrown exception type. If no catch block is found, the program flow moves to the next outer try-catch block or terminates if there is none.

Java Variables,Exception Propagation,Easy,"In addition to the built-in exception classes provided by Java, developers can create their own custom exception classes to handle specific error conditions. Custom exception classes are useful when the built-in exception classes do not accurately represent the exceptional situation or when additional information needs to be conveyed to the calling code. To create a custom exception class, the developer needs to extend the Exception or one of its subclasses. The custom exception class can then have additional fields and methods to provide more context and functionality. For example, consider a scenario where a banking application needs to handle insufficient balance errors. Instead of using the generic Exception class, a custom InsufficientBalanceException class can be created. This class can have fields such as the account number and the required balance, along with methods to retrieve this information. By creating custom exception classes, developers can provide more meaningful error messages and additional information to the calling code. This improves the overall error handling and makes the code more maintainable and readable.","['What are custom exception classes used for in Java?', 'How can developers create a custom exception class in Java?', 'Why are custom exception classes useful in a banking application?']"

Java Variables,Exception Chaining,Easy,"In Java, exceptions can propagate up the call stack if they are not caught and handled within the current method. This means that if a method throws an exception, the calling method can choose to catch and handle it or let it propagate further up the call stack. When an exception propagates up the call stack, each method in the call hierarchy is given an opportunity to catch and handle the exception. If no catch block is found, the exception eventually reaches the top-level method, such as the main method, where it can be caught and handled or cause the program to terminate. Exception propagation allows for a flexible error handling mechanism where exceptions can be handled at different levels of the program. It provides a way to separate the code that throws an exception from the code that handles it, improving code modularity and maintainability. However, it is important to note that excessive exception propagation can make the code harder to understand and debug. It is generally recommended to catch and handle exceptions at the appropriate level, rather than letting them propagate too far up the call stack.","['What happens if an exception is not caught and handled within a method in Java?', 'What is the purpose of exception propagation in Java?', 'Why is it important to catch and handle exceptions at the appropriate level in Java?']"

Java Variables,Exception Handling Best Practices,Easy,"In Java, exceptions can be chained together to provide more information about the cause of an exception. Exception chaining allows developers to create a chain of exceptions, where each exception represents a different level of the error. When an exception is thrown, it can be caught and wrapped in a new exception using the constructor that takes a cause parameter. This creates a new exception that contains the original exception as its cause. The cause exception can then be accessed using the getCause() method. Exception chaining is useful when the calling code needs to know the root cause of an exception. For example, if a database connection fails due to a network error, the SQLException can be wrapped in a custom DatabaseConnectionException, with the original SQLException as the cause. This way, the calling code can catch the DatabaseConnectionException and retrieve the original SQLException for further analysis. By using exception chaining, developers can provide more detailed error information to the calling code, making it easier to diagnose and fix issues. It also helps in maintaining a clear separation between the code that throws an exception and the code that handles it.","['What is exception chaining in Java?', 'How can an exception be caught and wrapped in a new exception?', 'Why is exception chaining useful in Java?']"
